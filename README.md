# Lip_Sync_Using_Wav2Lip
 
Prerequisites
-------------
- `Python 3.6` 
- ffmpeg: `sudo apt-get install ffmpeg`
- Install necessary packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Face detection [pre-trained model](https://www.adrianbulat.com/downloads/python-fan/s3fd-619a316812.pth) should be downloaded to `face_detection/detection/sfd/s3fd.pth`. Alternative [link](https://iiitaphyd-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/prajwal_k_research_iiit_ac_in/EZsy6qWuivtDnANIG73iHjIBjMSoojcIV0NULXV-yiuiIg?e=qTasa8) if the above does not work.

## Quick Guide
1. Create video file named `input_video.mp4`. Please check `Inputs/` for the input video I used.
2. Create audio file named `input_audio.wav`. Please check `Inputs/` for the input audio I used.
3. Both file have to be of similar length
4. Target face in the input_video.mp4 must be "detectable" in all video frames
5. Make sure you use correct file extension (.mp4 and .wav)
6. Wav2Lip does not like very long and high resolution videos. Try to keep the video length under 30 seconds(max 60 seconds) and resolution under 720p(max 1080p).
