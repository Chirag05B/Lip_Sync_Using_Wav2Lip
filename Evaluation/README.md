# Steps to set-up evaluation for LSE-D and LSE-C metric:

1. Clone the SyncNet and Wav2Lip repositories
2. Install the dependencies and download the pretrained models
3. Copy the evaluation scripts from `Wav2Lip/evaluation/scores_LSE` to the cloned SyncNet repository
4. Import the generated lip synced video from your local drive
5. Run the evaluation script to calculate the LSE-D and LSE-C scores

Please see the `Lip_sync_evaluation.ipynb` notebook for the detailed steps.
